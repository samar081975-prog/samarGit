# Sentiment analysis of hotel reviews

## Problem description
Our goal is to perform sentiment analysis of textual reviews of hotel stays. We want to understand whether the users expressed positive or negative feelings in their comments. To do this, we build a binary classification model that is able to predict the sentiment contained in hotel reviews.

The dataset contains more than twenty thousand hotel reviews, scraped from the [tripadvisor.it](https://www.tripadvisor.it/) Italian website. Each review is labeled either positive or negative. The Polytechnic University of Turin has provided this dataset for the Data Science Lab: Process and methods exam project in the academic year 2019/2020.

## Implementation
Python 3.7.5 and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) along with the following packages are required to run the code.

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) 1.8.0
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) 2.2.4
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 2.2.3
